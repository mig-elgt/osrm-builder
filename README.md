# OSRM Builder

OSRM Builder implements Multi-Level Dijkstra (MLD) pre-processing pipeline to build a OSRM Server using Docker.

## Features

* Fetch OpenStreetMap extracts (OSM Data file) from [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/).
* Pre-process the extract with the car profile.
* Upload pre-process files to Google Storage.

# Install using Docker

You will need to install Docker and create a Google Service Account to use a storage in order to upload the OSRM Builder files.

```
$ docker build --no-cache osrm/osrm-server-builder:v1 .
```

## Usage & Example

```
$ 
docker run -v /tmp:/secrets --env GEOFABRIK_URL=http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/monaco-latest.osm.pbf --env BUCKET_NAME=osrm-monaco-server --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/secrets/services_account.json osrm/osrm-server-builder:v1
